<!-- WORKAROUND
This is related to bug JAXB-687 [1] where a binding file is applied multiple
times in a compilation and causes the "only one globalBindings customization
is allowed in a whole compilation" error.

It was 'fixed' in jaxb 2.1.13, but not completely. The second fix JAXB-695 [2]
was fixed only in some version of 2.2.  There does not appear to be a 2.1.14
on the roadmap. I can't get the plugin to use 2.2. And the new jaxb site at
highsource.org is down.

So, the workaround is to simply have one schema declare the globalBindings.
