Hi,
rounded rectangles really look good in reports!
That's why I've written the QRRoundRect component for QuickReports.
It should work well under Delphi 1, Delphi 2 and Delphi 3 -
if not, please let me know.

It's the FIRST component I have written, so I want to contribute
it to the Delphi community. Delphi is such a GREAT development tool,
and there are so many great people out there helping us all to achieve
the results we need by donating their components for free ... this
utility component is one of my reciprocal contributions for that.

Since it's my first component, please tell me, how to get the 
toolbar icon to show up correctly - I failed with that... :-)

If you like, please visit our "DELPHI-BOX" website, one of the best
starting points for Delphi programmers. It offers more than *1000*
links and infos about and around Delphi!

And if you are looking for a smart setup program that can create
single-EXE-archives (and other types of very tiny distribution archives),
which offer FULL setup functionality, but just require some KB's more
than a regular ZIP file, we'd like to invite you to try INF-Tool, the
INF setup generator. Available from our download page.
