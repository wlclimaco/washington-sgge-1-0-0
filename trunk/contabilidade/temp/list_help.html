	<h1>Overview Lists</h1>
	<h2>Note</h2>
	<p>This page will be used in many places for many sets of data.
		Separate generic functionality and specific configuration as much as
		possible to support reuse.</p>
	<h2>Back/Forward Button State</h2>
	<p>Show default settings (page, page size etc.). In the future we
		may include more state, like back button returns to previous data page
		in table.</p>
	<h2>Checkbox selector</h2>
	<p>Visuals only, no functionality</p>
	<h2>Hover Actions</h2>
	<p>Link to edit page/ implement delete with rudimentary dialog.
		Don't worry about dialog formatting</p>
	<h2>Dialogs</h2>
	<p>Formatting TBD. At this point, all dialogs we have are modal;
		use a gray, semitransparent overlay to indicate that fact.</p>
