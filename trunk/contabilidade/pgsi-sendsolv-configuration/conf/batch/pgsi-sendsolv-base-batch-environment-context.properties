# The confirmation number received from the automated clearing house is used to fetch the MoneyTransfer in SendSolv.
# The processing logic will use the following flag to decide whether to throw an exception or just skip the notification
# if the lookup returns none found.  In the DEV and TEST applications, both share the same connection with the automated
# clearing house, so we could get back confirmations in DEV that are really in TEST, and in TEST that are really in DEV.
# This flag allows those jobs to continue processing if the fetch fails.
# Valid values:
# 	true : Will bypass throwing the exception, and the record will be written to the skip file.
# 	false: Will throw the exception.
